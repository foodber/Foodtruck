Project Title: Foodber
Two mobile applications, one for customers and one for business owners. 

Business Owners can use their app to receive orders from customers. They can edit their menu by either adding or removing items. Business owners can set themselves as either open or closed within the map tab, which will show up in real time for the customers.

The lack of modern day application providing real time data of actual food truck locations and actual operating hours.
